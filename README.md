# Face_detection
A face detection project utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and locate human faces within images or video frames. It involves the implementation of algorithms, such as Haar Cascade classifiers or deep learning models, for accurate and efficient face localization. The project may use popular libraries like OpenCV and may include features like real-time detection, bounding box visualization, and a user interface for interaction. Common applications include security systems, facial recognition, and human-computer interaction. Challenges include variations in lighting, facial expressions, and occlusion. Future enhancements may involve integration with facial recognition and continuous improvement through retraining with diverse datasets.
